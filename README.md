# Snake-Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game developed using Java. The game provides a nostalgic experience for players who enjoy retro gaming and challenges them to grow their snake while avoiding collisions with obstacles or itself.

Features :

1. Snake Movement: Control the movement of the snake using arrow keys or WASD keys.
2. Fruit Consumption: The snake grows in length upon consuming fruits placed randomly on the game board.
3. Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with obstacles or itself.


How to Play :
1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or the WASD keys (W, A, S, D) to control the direction of the snake.
2. Guide the snake to consume fruits while avoiding collisions with obstacles or itself.
3. The game ends if the snake collides with obstacles or itself.
4. Try to achieve the highest score possible by consuming as many fruits as you can without crashing.
